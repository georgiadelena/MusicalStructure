# MusicalStructure
Musical Structure project for Udacity's Nanodegree Scholarship.

The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a
GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music, so at this stage, it doesn't.
